## K-mer class for rust

The purpose of this repository is to build a simple library that exposes a bit-packed
k-mer class for use in rust-based bioinformatics projects.  The class implementation 
is generic over the k-mer length by making use of const generics (which are currently 
a relatively new feature in rust).
